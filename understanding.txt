Assuming you know how to print hello world in cpp you can probably understand how it is structured.

there are four files,
a main.cpp
an offsets.hpp
a RobloxFunc.hpp
and a MemUtils.hpp.

first of all,
the offsets.cpp contain all of the offsets ofc
An offset is the numerical distance (usually in bytes) from a base memory address to a specific data or instruction location.

secondly,
the MemUtils.hpp
contains many of the functions related to memory like getting the process id, the base adress and the read and write

thirdly,
the RobloxFunc containts functions like the getname() which returns the name of smth from its address
or finding the datamodel or finding the character

lastly,
the main.cpp is were everything comes together and it changes the walkspeed
